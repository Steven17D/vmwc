## Simplified VMWare API client

vmc is designed to be the simplest way possible to use VMWare's api library - [pyvmomi](https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi).


```python

from vmc import VMWareClient

host = '192.168.1.1'
username = '<username>'
password = '<password>'

with VMWareClient(host, username, password) as client:
    for vm in client.get_virtual_machines():
        vm.power_on()

```

### Installation

```
pip install vmc
```
